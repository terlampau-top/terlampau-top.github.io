Inspired by julia evans post in here [wizardzines](https://wizardzines.com/comics/list-what-youve-learned/)

I'm gonna list what I have learned as a post in this blog. It's been quiet dusty too since I didn't post anything in the last 2 months.


## I've been doing nothing on some bug in my live projects.
- i'm taking notes on what part in x project that didn't work as expected or need improvement
- it make me sad because I'm neglecting projects that I put live
- the projects have bad README.md
- I should have write better README.md. Especially list how to setup and ship a fix or patch.
