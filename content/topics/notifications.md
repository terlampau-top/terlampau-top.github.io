I hate notifications because it's give me something by defaults. Notifications should only given if I wanted it.

There is some kind of notifications.

1. Email
2. Chat
3. Phone notifications

In the past when it's only my computer and my nokia java phone. I'm pretty good to keep thing in balanced, between my study and playtime. But it's change since I have android.

Nowadays, Android ask user permission if this notifications is allowed or not by asking the user. But it's notifications permission, not notification individually based on it's kind or purpose.

Example if I install instagram application. Initially it will ask if permissions allowed or not. If I allowed it, it will give me lot of kinds notifications enabled by defaults. Which is sucks. I want to allow it but only for chat DM (direct messages) notification. I can fix it if I go to settings and select what kind of notification specifically. So it's kinda fine. But this kind of design used a lot by android developers. Design that make you addicted. Especially with AI, most of the time it will give you something interesting that make you click it, spend some time then forgot your goal. Then you only get reminded of your goal after life give you a reality check.

Then there is email notifications if I sign up on a website. It give me lot of kinds email by defaults like News, Updates, Promotions, etc. I don't care and I don't want all of that. "Hey, I'm just sign up. I'm still trying if this website is worthy for it's service, I don't want to get update about it's features, promotions or news".
