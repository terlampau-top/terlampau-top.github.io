List of projects that live and still maintained by me.

- clock-in-task-fyne
  
  Desktop app built with go using fyne-toolkit. This desktop app will sync with current task that running in org-pomodoro within emacs application. It will show total minutes that I working on this, effort estimation in minutes and task title.
  
  emacs already have builtin taskbar that show total minutes clocked, effort estimation and task title with remaining time.
  
  but it only show when emacs opened, most of the time I want to know the pomodoro timer everywhere.
  
  that's why I make desktop app that I set as floating window and put it on top of KDE taskbar.
